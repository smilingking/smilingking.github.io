                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5"><strong>‘The Alchemist’ is one of the most famous book of all time, with more than 150 million copies sold. It is available in over 80 different languages and is one of my favorites. ‘The Alchemist’ was the second book by Paulo Coelho, the first one was ‘The pilgrimage’. Paulo Coelho was 42 when he wrote ‘The Alchemist’.</strong><br><br><strong>‘The Alchemist’ is loved all around the world because it has all that everyone desires, adventure, love, passion, people. One of the best thing about this book is its characters, these are the type of people we meet regularly, people who don’t have a dream and living their life as it comes, people who have a dream but are not pursuing it, people who know what they want but don’t know how to do it and those who are on their path to their destiny.&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>I learned some really important lessons from this book and I want to share it with all of you.
</strong><div><strong>&nbsp;Here are the top 5 lessons from ‘The Alchemist’ …
</strong></div><br><div><strong>1. Believe</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;In the book, when the boy was confronted with the idea of a hidden treasure in pyramids, he got confused, he was already accustomed to being a shepherd, being a shepherd for more than 2 years, he had learned everything about shepherding. When the boy realized that he didn’t have to be a shepherd to be happy and he could be free and go for his treasure, he decided to just sell all of his sheep and travel to Egypt. That was a really good lesson for me because most of the people believe that they can’t have the life they dream about because they will have to leave their loved ones behind, but that is not the case, the people who love you, know what you are trying to do and after some resistance, they let you be you. You can always make a choice and do what you want. BELIEVE that you can do it.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>2. &nbsp;FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN</strong></div><br><div><strong> Most of us don’t try to talk to new people because we are skeptical of how it will go, what if they are not good? What if we fuck up the interaction? 
</strong></div><div><strong>We fear of going to new places until we get assurance that it will be ok. We fear to get into a new relationship because we don’t know how it will go. 
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>The boy in the book had a lot of such moments, where he thought about going back to being a shepherd, but he knew what his life would be like if he went back, he will regret not going for treasure so he continued his journey. That’s what we have to understand, the regret of not trying is worse than staying in comfort zone.
</strong></div><br><div><strong>3. &nbsp;THE PROCESS:- 
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;This one is my favorite because when we think about a dream, we imagine the end result, we imagine being a blogger with millions of readers, being a guy with great social skills, a traveler who meets a ton of cool people, but we don’t think about the process. The journey is as important, if not more, than destiny. The failures, success, betrayals, love, hardship, unproductive days and our mindset in all the situations will make us stronger and more worthy of our destiny.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;The boy in the book had his money stolen, then he started working in a crystal shop, he made the crystal shop successful and helped his owner to understand about destiny. He went through the heat of desert and the threat from an army. He found love and learned to be an alchemist. After his long journey towards the treasure, he became a different person than he was before, the treasure without the long journey wouldn’t made much difference in his life.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>4. HELP OTHERS BY HELPING YOURSELF</strong></div><br><div><strong>In the story, the boy made the crystal shop more successful because he wanted money, he made the Englishman in understanding alchemy because he wanted to understand it himself. The boy helped the army of the oasis because he was learning to read omens.
</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;As this line from the book says, “When something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>These were the things I learned from ‘The Alchemist’, Is there any other book you want me to write about? What did you learn from ‘The alchemist’? Write in the comments below!
