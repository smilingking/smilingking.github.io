{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In my experience, scrolling through job boards pumping out applications targeted at large companies isn‚Äôt the best way to go about <a href=\"https://eulercoder.me/2017/07/summer-internship-ultimate-guide/\">getting a job or internship</a>. By following a few people on LinkedIn, I managed to get into a conversation with Laszlo Bock, the Former Head of People Operations at Google. Here are a few LinkedIn tips on how to take full advantage of your LinkedIn feed.</p>\n<h2>LinkedIn Tips #1: Finding who to follow</h2>\n<p>Looking for people to follow can be daunting, but with a little effort, your LinkedIn will supply with tons of useful information. An easy place to start is to click on the 3 dots in the top right any post, and click ‚Äúimprove my feed‚Äù</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Following people at companies you want to work for is another easy start. Generally, a few people in every company are very active on LinkedIn. Sometimes they post information about what they like to see at their company and what they are working on (and that knowledge pays off in interviews!)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look at the top contributors on LinkedIn, a lot of them post articles almost daily.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Find influential figures, such as Bill Gates. They also post relevant content, especially if they work in tech.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some people (or companies) that don‚Äôt work in tech can post useful information too though. For example, Asana, a tool like Slack, has a great LinkedIn and posts lots of workplace-focused articles</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- more -->\n<h4>If you go to college, follow your professors! Some professors are very active outside of teaching and have very active LinkedIn profiles.</h4>\n<p>Read <a href=\"https://eulercoder.me/2017/08/college-low-gpa-know-everything/\">College and Low GPA: Everything you need to know.</a><a href=\"https://eulercoder.me/2017/08/college-low-gpa-know-everything/\"> </a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If you don‚Äôt go to college, you can apply this concept by following professors at nearby or prestigious universities. For example, some Stanford professors post a lot of content and are worth following.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, follow all the people you know! I find it fascinating to see what people I used to work with are up to, and some are working at places I dream of working at.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Read: <a href=\"https://eulercoder.me/2017/07/slack-internship-sf-silicon-valley/\">Slack Internship, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley</a></h4>\n<p><strong>Make sure to like and/or comment on things you see on LinkedIn</strong>; your activity shows up on your profile and it looks good if your profile is lively. Being active on LinkedIn shows you care about your professional image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eulercoder.me/2017/07/summer-internship-ultimate-guide/\"><img src=\"https://eulercoder.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Internship-in-article-post.jpg\" alt=\"Summer Internship guide on eulercoder\"></a></p>\n<p>[clickToTweet tweet=\"‚Äú80% of jobs are found through networking and recommendations‚Äù \" quote=\"‚Äú80% of jobs are found through networking and recommendations‚Äù \"]</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>LinkedIn Tips #2: Parsing your newly active feed</h2>\n<p>After a round of following people, refresh your feed and see if you like the content. I prefer some balance to my feed; I follow a few people who aren‚Äôt business serious all the time, and it helps me scroll through my feed without boredom.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Try to identify people whose content you like:</strong> Just like on Facebook or Instagram, there are always people you look forward to seeing more content from, and clicking on their content and liking it lets LinkedIn‚Äôs feed algorithm know you want to see more of them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>**Remove people you find dull or boring: **Try to avoid following people who you actively avoid when scrolling through your feed. I remove people or companies that post lots of clickbait-style articles.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>**Save interesting articles: **Keeping a list of articles that had interesting content or titles for later is great for curbing boredom and you can get even more out of your feed. I try to read at least one helpful article each time I scroll through my feed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Have you read: <a href=\"https://eulercoder.me/2017/07/slack-amazon-mozilla-linkedin-interview/\">My Internship Interview Experience with Amazon, Slack, Mozilla, LinkedIn, and Browserstack? </a></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>**Rise and repeat! **This process should be organic and repeated a few times, especially when your interests change or you switch positions. It took me about a month to get it where I was very happy with my feed, and I visited the site a couple of times a week.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope these LinkedIn tips help make LinkedIn more appealing as a place to get information. If you don‚Äôt have a LinkedIn account already, I would _highly _recommend getting one. It might take a while to set up the first time, but updating is quite easy. It works as a pseudo-resume and allows employers to see a lot more about yourself. I include my LinkedIn on my resume and use my LinkedIn to go into further detail about what is on my resume.</p>\n<h3>Final LinkedIn Tips:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Follow companies on LinkedIn and people who work at those companies</strong>. They post information about hiring every once in a while; they also post great articles to read about what they do and like. Employers can also see who you follow Sand if you follow their company on LinkedIn. This can help you not get filtered out and shows you really care about the position and company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>**Stay active: **After spending time setting up an account and customizing your feed, why not enjoy all the hard work you put in? Keep scrolling, posting, and updating your feed so it stays relevant to your interests. A little work here and there makes your LinkedIn feel like a lot less work overall</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>**Have fun: **If it feels like you‚Äôre falling into a pit of professionalism, spice it up a bit and post something that you‚Äôre happy about. Even if it‚Äôs something you work on outside of your job, posting about hobbies shows your multidimensional, and that is very appealing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That's all!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>**Have something to talk about?
