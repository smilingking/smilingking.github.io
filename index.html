hello all!

I was just sitting in front of my laptop trying to write my thoughts about something.
I think i should try write on something that is too important in today's world and that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_skill">COMMUNICATION SKILLS</a>.
<div class="container" style="padding-bottom:0px;padding-top: 0px;"><img style="width:300px;height:300px;" src="https://www.clipartsgram.com/image/684523697-effective-communication-clipart-1.jpg"></div>
It is something you need to express your thoughts to people,to impress others,to know others,to make more friends.... and a lot of other things.
You might be thinking that i am here to give a speech about "How to improve your communication skills".But I myself am not good with talking to <br>others and making friends.To be honest,I am a person with "ZERO COMMUNICATION SKILLS".
<div class="container" style="padding-bottom:0px;padding-top: 0px;"><img style="width:500px;height:500px;" src="https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder374/63667374.jpg"></div>
And i face some problems because of "ZERO COMMUNICATION SKILLS".
There are many people like me who are shy.They don't ask something to people directly.They don't ask any question to sir/teacher,even if <br>they have a solid doubt about the topic being taught in the class.
